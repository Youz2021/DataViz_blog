# 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Backgroud of the case

Several employees of GAStech go missing, the case is under investigation.

Many of the Abila, Kronos-based employees of GAStech have company cars which were installed geospatial tracking software to track data periodically as long as they are moving.

This vehicle tracking data has been made available to law enforcement to support their investigation. Unfortunately, data is not available for the day the GAStech employees went missing. Data is only available for the two weeks prior to the disappearance.

Also, Kronos based companies provide a Kronos Kares benefit card to GASTech employees giving them discounts and rewards in exchange for collecting information about their credit card purchases and preferences as recorded on loyalty cards. This data has been made available to investigators in the hopes that it can help resolve the situation.

### 1.2 Objectives of this report

The objectives of this case analysis report is to identify which GASTech employees made which purchases and identify suspicious patterns of behavior. 
During the analysis, 3 aspects were taken into consideration:

1. Using just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. Also, recommendations should be given to correct these anomalies.

2. Add the vehicle data to analysis of the credit and loyalty card data and figure out the discrepancies between vehicle, credit, and loyalty card data.

3. Infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card and provide the evidences for that.

# 2. Literature Review

In the literature review conducted, it was found that there were some geospatial data in the datasets. To delivery a clear analysis based on tracking movement trace, I examined how to visualise movement data by using appropriate R packages. Also, as there were two card datasets provided for analysis and we need to explore the relationships between two kind of cards, I examined how join and merge tables by using appropriate R packages. Besides, I
did some research about ggplot packages in order to plot some appropriate charts to visualisation.

To get a better understanding about the relationship between employee and credit card, some network data visualisation and analysis techniques would be used. For example, build network graph visualisation using appropriate functions of ggraph.

# 3. Data Preperation

### 3.1 Install and load packages

We need to set up the environment and load all required packages first. The code chunk below will install the packages if not yet installed, and load them to the environment.

```{r}
packages = c('ggiraph', 'plotly', 'DT', 'patchwork','plyr','palmerpenguins',
             'tidyverse','raster', 'sf', 'igraph', 'tidygraph', 'mapview',
             'ggraph', 'visNetwork', 'rgdal','ggbeeswarm','ggforce',
             'lubridate', 'clock','tmap','rmarkdown')

for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```

### 3.2 Import data

The data was loaded using read.csv() of the readr package, which reads delimited files into a tibble.

```{r}
cc_data <- read.csv("MC2/cc_data.csv")
loyalty_data <- read.csv("MC2/loyalty_data.csv")
gps <- read.csv("MC2/gps.csv")
car_assignments <- read.csv("MC2/car-assignments.csv")
```

### 3.3 Data processing

1. Change variables to the proper data type and create new variables for further analysis.

```{r}
cc_data$timestamp <- date_time_parse(cc_data$timestamp,
                                 zone = "",
                                 format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")

cc_data$date <- substr(cc_data$timestamp,1,10)

cc_data$date <- date_parse(cc_data$date,format = "%Y-%m-%d")

loyalty_data$date <- date_parse(loyalty_data$timestamp,
                                format = "%m/%d/%Y")
```

2. Combine credit card data and loyalty card data into a new data frame based on the same location, timestamp and price in order to identify the most popular place and the most popular timeslot. Also, rename the columns for the new data frame.

```{r}
combine_cc_loyalty = cc_data %>% inner_join(loyalty_data,
                                          by=c('location','price','date'))
sum_by_location <- combine_cc_loyalty %>%
select(location, price) %>%
group_by(location) %>%
summarise(total_price = sum(price), total_count = n()) %>%
arrange(desc(total_count), desc(total_price))

colnames(combine_cc_loyalty)[1] <- "timestamp"
```


3. Compare the credit and loyalty card data and their joint data to explore whether they are consistent.

```{r}
nrow(cc_data)
nrow(loyalty_data)
nrow(combine_cc_loyalty)
```

4. Merge the transactions exiting in loyalty card data but not exiting in the credit card data to the credit card data in order to make up the missing transactions in credit card data.

```{r}
new_cc_data <- merge(cc_data, combine_cc_loyalty,
                              by=c('timestamp','location','price','last4ccnum'),all=TRUE)

new_cc_data <- new_cc_data[-c(488,497,507,513,674,683),] %>%
  select(timestamp,location, price,last4ccnum,date.x,loyaltynum)

colnames(new_cc_data)[5] <- "date"

new_loyalty_data <- merge(loyalty_data, combine_cc_loyalty,
                              by=c('date','location','price','loyaltynum'),all=TRUE)

new_loyalty_data <- new_loyalty_data[-c(610,412,465,415,612,468),] %>%
  select(date,location, price,last4ccnum,loyaltynum)

new_cc_loyalty_data <-  union(left_join(new_cc_data, new_loyalty_data),
                              right_join(new_cc_data, new_loyalty_data))

glimpse(new_cc_loyalty_data)
```


5. Summarize the frequency of transactions by location.

```{r}
sum_by_location <- new_cc_loyalty_data %>%
select(location, price) %>%
group_by(location) %>%
summarise(total_price = sum(price), total_count = n()) %>%
arrange(desc(total_count), desc(total_price))

glimpse(sum_by_location)
```


6. Mapping the credit card and loyalty card data based on the transactions with same location, transaction timestamp and price.

```{r}
cards_mapping <- new_cc_data %>%
  select(last4ccnum,loyaltynum) %>%
  filter(loyaltynum>0) %>%
  group_by(last4ccnum,loyaltynum) %>%
  summarise(total_count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_count))
  
```


# 4. Data analysis and visualisation

### 4.1 Most popular location

we identify the most popular locations based on shopping frequency and the amount of money spent. 

```{r}
ggplot(sum_by_location, aes(x = location)) +
  geom_col(aes( y = total_count, fill="steelblue")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Frequency") +
  scale_fill_manual('', labels = 'Frequency', values = "steelblue") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),legend.position="bottom")
```

### 4.2 Most popular timeslot

Based on the most popular location, we explore the most popular time people visit in 24 hours each day using heatmap graph, the darker the color is, the more popular the place is in this timeslot.

```{r}
popular_time <- new_cc_loyalty_data %>%
  select(location,date,timestamp,price)

popular_time$hour <- hour(popular_time$timestamp)

popular_time_count <- popular_time %>%
  group_by(location,hour) %>%
  summarise(frequency = n())

popular_time_count <- popular_time_count %>%
  right_join(expand.grid(location = unique(popular_time$location),
                       hour = c(1:23)),
             by =c('location','hour')) %>%
  replace_na(list(frequency = 0L))

ggplot(popular_time_count,aes( hour,location, fill= frequency)) + 
geom_tile(color = 'white',size = 0.1) + 
   scale_fill_distiller(palette = "orange",direction = 1)+
  scale_y_discrete()+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1,24,2)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),legend.position="bottom")
```

### 4.3 Anomalies about credit card and loyalty data

1. All the transactions happened at Brew've Been Served were paid around 17 different credit cards. That means just 17 people always went there. It is less than other three popular locations which have 33 or 35 different visitors in the last two weeks. 

```{r}
visitor_count_for_location <- new_cc_loyalty_data %>%
  select(location,last4ccnum) %>%
  filter(location == "Katerina’s Café"|location == "Guy's Gyros" |location == "Hippokampos"|location == "Brew've Been Served") %>%
  group_by(location,last4ccnum) %>%
  summarise(total_count = n()) %>%
  select(location) %>%
  group_by(location) %>%
  summarise(count_credit_cards=n()) %>%
  left_join(sum_by_location,by = c('location')) %>%
  select(location, count_credit_cards,total_count) %>%
  gather(count_credit_cards, total_count, key = "key", value = "value")

ggplot(visitor_count_for_location, aes(x = location)) +
  geom_col(aes( y = value, fill=key),position = "dodge",width = .5)
```


2. Although employees always went Katerina’s Café, Guy's Gyros, Hippokampos and Brew've Been Served, they did not spend too much money there. On the contrary, employees spent more at Abila Airport, Nationwide Refinery, Carlyle Chemical Inc. and Stewart and Sons Fabrication even though they did not purchase there frequently.

```{r}
ggplot(sum_by_location, aes(x = location)) +
  geom_col(aes( y = total_count, fill="steelblue")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = total_price/500, group = 1, color = 'orange')) +
  geom_point(aes(x=location, y=total_price/500, color="orange"))+
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Frequency", sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~ .* 500,name = "Price")) +
  scale_fill_manual('', labels = 'Frequency', values = "steelblue") +
  scale_color_manual('', labels = 'Total Price', values = 'orange') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),legend.position="bottom")
```

3. Some locations are just popular on weekdays.

```{r}
location_date <- new_cc_loyalty_data %>%
  select(location,date,last4ccnum,price) %>%
  group_by(location,date) %>%
  summarise(frequency = n())

location_date <- location_date %>%
  right_join(expand.grid(location = unique(new_cc_loyalty_data$location),
                       date = unique(new_cc_loyalty_data$date)),
             by =c('location','date')) %>%
  replace_na(list(frequency = 0L))

location_date$day <- as.factor(get_day(location_date$date))

ggplot(location_date,aes(location,day, fill= frequency)) + 
geom_tile(color = 'white',size = 0.1) + 
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "orange",direction = 1)+
  #scale_y_date(breaks = new_cc_loyalty_data$date[seq(1, length(new_cc_loyalty_data$date), by = 3)],labels = abbreviate)+
  scale_y_discrete(expand=c(0,0)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0,0)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),legend.position="bottom")

```


4. The price of some transactions varies largely in the same location.

```{r}
ggplot(new_cc_loyalty_data, aes(x= location,y= price, color ="orange")) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),legend.position="bottom")
  
```

### 4.5 Add vehicle data to the analysis of the credit and loyalty card data

1. Add and transform vehicle data for visualisation.

```{r}
bgmap <- raster("MC2/Geospatial/MC2-tourist.tif")

Abila_st <- st_read(dsn = "MC2/Geospatial",layer = "Abila")

gps$Timestamp <- date_time_parse(gps$Timestamp,zone = "",format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")

gps$day <- as.factor(get_day(gps$Timestamp))

gps$hour <-as.factor(get_hour(gps$Timestamp))

gps_sf <- st_as_sf(gps,coords = c("long", "lat"),crs= 4326)

gps_path <- gps_sf %>%
  group_by(id, day, hour) %>%
  summarize(m = mean(Timestamp),do_union=FALSE) %>%
  st_cast("LINESTRING")

p = npts(gps_path, by_feature = TRUE)
gps_path2 <- cbind(gps_path, p)

gps_path2 <- gps_path2 %>%
  filter(p>1)
```


2. PLot the track events for each car on the map to identify their activities.

```{r}
gps_path_selected <- gps_path2 %>%
  filter(id %in% c(28))

tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(bgmap) +tm_rgb(bgmap, r = 1,g = 2,b = 3,alpha = NA,saturation = 1,
                        interpolate = TRUE, max.value = 255) +
tm_shape(gps_path_selected) + 
  tm_lines(col = "orange")
  #tm_dots(size=.15, col="red")
```



# 5. Insights

### Q1. Analysis of the credit and loyalty card data

### 1.1 Most popular location and timeslot

1. Most popular locations
Katerina’s Café, Guy's Gyros, Hippokampos and Brew've Been Served are the places people go and visit most. Because more transactions were produced there.

![](img/location_most.png){width=90%}

2. Most popular timeslots

For most of locations, employees went there around 12pm to 14pm and 19pm to 20pm each day.These two timeslots are rightly corresponding to the lunch time and dinner time. Also, some locations are popular in the morning, around 7am to 8am, corresponding to the breakfast time, for example, Hallowed Grounds and Brew've Been Served.

![](img/hour_popular_new.png){width=90%}


### 1.2 Anomalies and corrections for credit card and loyalty card data

1. Transactions of credit card are inconsistent with loyalty cards'.

The reason for the inconsistency might be that some employees did not record transactions on loyalty card although they indeed purchase something using their credit card. For the same reason, some employees recorded the purchase on their loyalty card but they did not pay that using given credit card.

To correct this issue, we can merge the transactions exiting in loyalty card data but not exiting in the credit card data to the credit card data in order to make up the missing transactions in credit card data, then we can get a more comprehensive transaction data for purchases and preferences. 

![](img/inconsistent_resolve.png){width=35%}


2. Most popular locations are different with the locations with higher purchase amount.

Although employees always went Katerina’s Café, Guy's Gyros, Hippokampos and Brew've Been Served, they did not spend too much money there. On the contrary, employees spent more at Abila Airport, Nationwide Refinery, Carlyle Chemical Inc. and Stewart and Sons Fabrication even though they did not purchase there frequently.

For this issue, we can  category the location to explore the transactions produced by different business. Because the price of a order may vary from business to business.


![](img/frequency_price.png){width=90%}

3. The price of some transactions varies largely in the same location. For example, there is a transaction higher than others in 'Frydos Autosupply n' More'. We need to explore the anomalous transactions.

![](img/price_vary.png){width=90%}

4. Some locations are just popular on weekdays, for example, Abila Airport and Carlyle Chemical Inc.

Also, transactions in some locations are higher than regular in some days. For example, there were more transactions at Katerina’s Café on 8,11 and 18 January and more transactions at Brew've Been Served on 8, 14 and 15 January. We need to explore the actives on that days.

![](img/popular_location_date.png){width=90%}

5. Some transactions produced around 3am at 'Kronos Mart'.

![](img/3am_transaction.png){width=90%}


### Q2: Add the vehicle data to your analysis of the credit and loyalty card data.

### 2.1 Assessment of the anomalies in credit and loyalty card data

1. The reason why transactions of some locations, like Airport,Nationwide Refinery and Carlyle Chemical Inc. are not so frequent but the prices are higher than other locations might be that the transactions produced in those locations are for business of GAStech, since the employees went there are always the truck drivers. While the transactions produced in most popular locations, like Katerina’s Café, Guy's Gyros where are closed to GAStech office, are always related to general staff for lunch or dinner.

Also,t explains why some locations just had transactions on weekdays. These locations are business partners with GAStech, employee always went there for business on weekdays.

![](img/location_price.png){width=90%}

 
### 2.2 Discrepancies between vehicle, credit, and loyalty card data

1. The GPS data can not comply with transactions very well. 

As there is an anomalous transaction with amount is 10000 dollars happened at 'Frydos Autosupply n' More' on 13 January in credit and loyalty card data, and we knew that this employee also went to Ouzeri Elian on 17 January 19:30pm. However, we can not find out this employee by tracking the gps path based on carid.

As shown below, the id for cars been at 'Frydos Autosupply n' More' on 13 Jan are 34, 15 and 16, while id for cars been 'Ouzeri Elia' on 17 Jan are 1, 22 and 17. We cannot find a common car which been these two locations.

![](img/highest_price.png){width=90%}

2. There were some anomalous transactions happened around 3am in 'Kronos Mart', but we cannot find the gps path for these transactions.

![](img/3am_data.png){width=50%}


### Q3.Infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card.

1. According to the card transactions and gps data of cars, we can find that there were three employees used their credit cards at 'Chostus Hotel' and we can identify their car id using GPS data. Then we can link credit card to the owner of the car.

![](img/hotel_relation.png){width=90%}

2. Similarly, we can identify the owners of the credit cards used at 'Desafio Golf Course'. 

![](img/ceo.png){width=90%}

3. The owners of each credit card and loyalty card can be identified according to the transactions data, gps data for each car and owners of car data.

```{r}
owner_card <- read.csv("MC2/Card.csv")

owner_card <- owner_card %>%
  left_join(car_assignments, by ="CarID") %>%
  select(last4ccnum,loyaltynum,CarID, LastName, FirstName,CurrentEmploymentTitle) %>%
  filter(CarID >0) 

print(owner_card)
```


### Q4. Identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel.

1. According to the card transactions and vehicle data, we can find that both Elsa and Brand were engineers and they always went to the 'Chostus Hotel' together, they might be the couples. 

![](img/hotel_relation.png){width=90%}


### Q5. Evidence of suspicious activity

1. Some executives might go and play golf together at 'Desafio Golf Course' in the afternoon of 12 and 19 January.
