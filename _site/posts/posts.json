In this post, this visualisation will be evaluated in terms of clarity and aesthetics. Also, an makeover of this graph will be provided. \r\n2. Critiques and Recommendations\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nS/N\r\nCritiques\r\nComments\r\n1\r\nChart title is not precise – The title “Merchandise Trade of Top Six Trading Countries,2019-2020” does not convey the intent of the graph well. The chart refers to the merchandise trade of top six regions from 2019 to 2020, making it difficult to identify the ranking of the six markets quickly.\r\nChange title to “Merchandise Trade of Six Trading Regions from 2019 to 2020”.\r\n2\r\nThe scale of X axis is not correct – The scale of X axis should be from 2019 to 2021 that is inconsistent with the title of the graph. Also, the scale of values on X axis is year that is against the title of X axis.\r\nModify the scale of X axis of the graph only from 2019 to 2020 as presented in the title of the graph and change the scale of values on X axis to be month.\r\n3\r\nInappropriate usage of graph – A area graph is not a suitable graphing method to show the values of both import and export merchandise trade of regions. There are overlaps between the area of export and import merchandise trade, making it difficult to identify the information from export and import merchandise trade.\r\nIt would be much clearer if using a line graph to show the merchandise trade.\r\n4\r\nLack of captions in the graph – Captions can provide brief explanations accompanying to the graph.\r\nAdd captions at the bottom of the graph.\r\n2.2 Aesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nCritiques\r\nComments\r\n1\r\nThe font size and location of each region label – Font size of the label should be smaller than the title of the graph’s. The location of the label should be at the center to indicate the related area graph clearly.\r\nChange the font size of the region label smaller than the font size of title and move the label to the center of each area graph.\r\n2\r\nSix area graphs are redundant – It is not necessary to use six area graphs in this visualisation since the six area graphs have same coordinate axis and layouts.\r\nOnly keep one graph to show values with same coordinate axis and layouts.\r\n3\r\nColors used to differentiate the import and export merchandise trade do not highlight the graph – Colors used should be with higher degree of contrast to easy highlight the graph.\r\nUse colors with higher degree of contrast to differentiate the graph.\r\n4\r\nMultiple unit measurement of Y axis used in the graph – unit measurement of Y axis may make reader be confused.\r\nKeep the unit measurement of both Y axis and X axis uniform.\r\n3. Proposed Design\r\n4. Data Visualisation Steps\r\n4.1 Data preparation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
